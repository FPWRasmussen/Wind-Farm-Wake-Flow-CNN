# Wind-Farm-Wake-Flow-CNN

This repository contains the code and models for my master thesis project on "Long-Distance Wind Farm Flow Modelling" using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into three main folders:

1. `generate_pywake_sim/`
2. `machine_learning/`
3. `saved_models/`

### Generate PyWake Sim

The `generate_pywake_sim/` folder contains scripts for generating random wind farm training data using PyWake.

- `generate_pywake_sim.py`: Main script for generating the training data.
- `config.yaml`: Configuration file for wind farm generation parameters.

### Machine Learning

The `machine_learning/` folder contains the main training script and model definitions.

- `train.py`: Main script for training the CNN models.
- `models/`: Folder containing model architectures.
- `config.yaml`: Configuration file for training parameters.

### Saved Models

The `saved_models/` folder stores the trained model checkpoints.

## Usage

1. To generate training data:
   ```
   python generate_pywake_sim/generate_pywake_sim.py
   ```

2. To train the CNN models:
   ```
   python machine_learning/train.py
   ```

## Configuration

Adjust the `config.yaml` files in both `generate_pywake_sim/` and `machine_learning/` folders to modify the wind farm generation and training parameters respectively.
